B.A.T.M.A.N-III

BETTER APPROACH TO MOBILE AD-HOC NETWORKING

####################
# 1.) INTRODUCTION #
####################

B.A.T.M.A.N is a new approach to Ad-Hoc-Routing, unlike other algorithms
that we are aware of. Reactive MANET protocols search for routes when a node
initiates communication to a remote node. Proactive protocols (all
link-state algorithms and some distance-vector algorithms) calculate routes
proactively from all nodes to all nodes in the mesh-cloud, whether they are
necessary or not - while reactive protocols search for routes on demand.
B.A.T.M.A.N doesn't calculate or search for routes - it continuously detects
the existence of routes by forwarding and receiving broadcast packets, and
it proactively populates the routing-table with nodes in the mesh. The
algorithm does not try to find out which path packets follow to a remote
node. B.A.T.M.A.N merely checks which single hop neighbor it has to send a
package to in order to push it on the best way to a node in the mesh. If you
want to find out how B.A.T.M.A.N routes to a certain node, perform a

ping -R <destination address> 

Note that this command does not work with busy box (a multi-call binary,
the 'swiss knife' for embedded Linux systems, used for example in
OpenWRT and Freifunk firmware), since 'ping' doesn't have the -R
option in busybox. You can do

traceroute -n <destination address>

instead.

# 2.) EVOLUTION #
#################

B.A.T.M.A.N-III is the third stage in the evolution of the
B.A.T.M.A.N.  algorithm - hence the numbering scheme. B.A.T.M.A.N-I
didn't check for bidirectional link conditions when forwarding
packets. This was an obvious design flaw. We didn't bother to add
bidirectional link checks in the first experimental implementation
that was meant to merely test the algorithm. The results of
B.A.T.M.A.N-I were however promising, so B.A.T.M.A.N-II was
implemented introducing a simple mechanism to check for bidirectional
links to perform further tests in real-live scenarios.

B.A.T.M.A.N-II implemented the bare algorithm with bi-directional link
checks for meshnodes with one interface only and was tested in the
Freifunk meshclouds of Berlin and Weimar. Thank you very much, you are
really brave guys! It was working quite nice on PCs, but the quick and
dirty implementation was causing high CPU-Loads on embedded systems
and even broadcast packet storms!

We found out that the algorithm of B.A.T.M.A.N-II still had its
flaws. We identified conditions where B.A.T.M.A.N-II would choose
routes far from optimal and even could cause routing loops. Hence
B.A.T.M.A.N-III implements changes in the algorithm to cope with these
scenarios.

Some new features, namely Internet gateway detection and
auto-negotiation of IP-Tunnels, have been added. Support for multiple
interfaces per node has been implemented. And last but not least we
have a mechanism to collect link state information in a centralized
server so people can download data from this server to display those
fancy three-dimensional meshclouds with s3d or two-dimensional with
dot-draw.

Now B.A.T.M.A.N-III has - in theory - everything to replace other MANET
routing daemons. As this is a young and experimental development it needs
further testing to improve maturity, of course. 

We are having a party today - December 13th 2006 at c-base in Berlin, to celebrate
the release of this milestone as B.A.T.M.A.N-III-0.1!

B.A.T.M.A.N. will have a hard time to gain the same popularity like olsrd
from olsr.org. OLSR is now the same for community mesh networks in Europe
and elsewhere what 'Tempo' is for handkerchiefs in Germany. Tempo is a
German brand that produces handkerchiefs. Germans with a cold rather ask for
a 'Tempo' than for a 'Taschentuch' (= handkerchief).

The formula: 

OLSR = Community Mesh Network 

is now established in the minds of community networkers today. 

It is overwhelming to see what olsr.org has been growing into. Let's wait and see
the way that B.A.T.M.A.N. goes :)

# 3.) MANET THEORY AND B.A.T.M.A.N  #
#####################################

A node in a B.A.T.M.A.N-MANET is only interested to learn about the
existence of all nodes that it can communicate with, either in single or
multi-hop range, and which single hop neighbor it has to choose as a router
to a certain destination. To communicate with a node in multi-hop range a
B.A.T.M.A.N node only needs to know which single hop neighbor is the best
to send its packets to, so that the packets takes the best way to the node
in the distance. To explain the advantage of this approach it may be best to
compare it with other ideas about mesh routing - namely source routing and
link state routing.

Reactive (Source Routing) Algorithms

Source routing means a node Y in the mesh 'thinks', that the best way to
send data to node D is a path where the packet travels from node Q to node
S, from node S to node H, from H to W - and so on - until the data
terminates at the destination node. Y gives Q the directive to send the data
to S. S receives the directive from Y to send the data to H - the whole
chain is planned by the originator of the traffic. So Y computes the path to
D and tells intermediate nodes what to do.

One known design for MANET Routing is DSR - Dynamic Source Routing. DSR
contains an algorithm that aims to find source routes and to maintain them,
in case they break down. The fly in the ointment is, that MANETs are subject
to highly dynamic changes. A MANET does not only lose payload data, but
loses topology information also. If the originator is several hops away from
the destination it is very likely that the information about the topology on
the other end is very hazy, incomplete and outdated. The originator is the
node most incompetent to decide the path of the data on the other end of the
path. The chain could be already broken down before Y sends its first
packet. Y then receives a message that the destination host is unreachable
and starts looking for a new path again.

Proactive (Link State Routing) Algorithms

In a mesh with proactive link state routing (LSR) every node tries to
calculate routes valid for the whole mesh from every single node to every
other. Fortunately this does not mean source routing, because the view about
the topology in the distance is hazy, too. In fact every node maintains a
individual huge database and computes paths that packets should follow and
hands payload packets confidingly to the next neighbor on the path that it
has calculated. While one node may believe that it knows the path that the
packages are actually going to travel, each node maintains its own database
and calculates its own paths. So every node autonomously computes its own
decisions when initiating or forwarding traffic.

There are two flies in the ointment that come with this approach. First
tradeoff is the calculation of huge databases, while all a node can decide
is select the next single hop neighbor that it hands a packet to. Second
the databases in nodes in a mesh with a considerable number of nodes are
never really consistent - so routing loops can occur if the route
calculations of two nodes involved in forwarding traffic are not in sync and
collide with each other. Link state routing therefore bears a lot of
overhead and problems. The advantage compared to source routing is that a
node closer to the destination has better information about the status of
the topology and can compute better decisions about the path.

If routing loops occur you get the message 'Time to live exceeded' when
performing a 'ping'.

The link state routing protocol (LSR) that is most popular today in the open
source world is OLSR from olsr.org. OLSR with LinkQualityExtension and
Fisheye-Algorithm works quite well, apart from a few bugs and the annoying
effect, that it too often switches between internet gateways which causes
problems (connections break down, timeouts). OLSR lacks an IP-Tunnel-Plugin
that would users allow to select their gateways.

In conclusion the algorithm of OLSR is too complicated for its own good and
draws too much CPU-Power. So it is time for something more simple and more
effective.

There is a well known quotation from Antoine Saint Exupery, Author of the 'The
little prince':

All human doing goes the way from the primitive along the complicated to the
simple. 

B.A.T.M.A.N. could be a milestone in the development of a simple yet well
performing routing algorithm for MANETs.

B.A.T.M.A.N. is a simple set of rules a node has to comply with.



##########################
# B.A.T.M.A.N. ALGORITHM #
##########################


NOTE:
A firewall must not block B.A.T.M.A.N traffic. B.A.T.M.A.N sends its
packets on Port 1966 UDP. This port must be open for incoming and outgoing
UDP traffic.


B.A.T.M.A.N detects neighbors and distant nodes by transmitting, receiving
and repeating broadcasts according to the rules of the B.A.T.M.A.N.
algorithm. These broadcasts travel through the mesh-cloud until they are
lost or nobody has to rebroadcast them any more. Once a node receives a
broadcast message initiated from a distant node it is aware of the existence
of the node.


ORIGINATOR MESSAGES

A broadcast (we will call it originator message from now on) contains
at least the originator address, a sequence number and a TTL. TTL or
Time-To-Live is a counter that is decremented by 1 every time before
the packet is rebroadcasted. If the TTL value reaches 0 the packet is
dropped. The TTL is used in IP packets to avoid packets endlessly
travelling around. This is a common mechanism. If the initial
TTL-Value is known, the TTL does also tell the receiver how often a originator
message has been rebroadcasted.

Particular important for B.A.T.M.A.N. is the sequence number. Originators
number their broadcasts so other nodes can decide whether they receive a
originator message the first time or repeatedly.

Originator messages are initiated from every node at a given interval and
forwarded by all other nodes according to the rules of the algorithm. If a
broadcast gets lost it is not resend.

Imagine we have a chain of mesh nodes (A,B,C,D):

   A <--> B <--> C <--> D

Imagine further that every node can only see its direct neighbors. Now node A
broadcasts a originator-message. Node B receives the message and rebroadcasts it. 

Thereby node C receives the information: Message from node A, forwarded from
node B, sequence number 0, TTL 49

Node C forwards the message again. Thus node D receives the information:
message from node A, forwarded by node C, sequence number 0, TTL 48

Now node D knows:

There is a node A that is three hops away. In order to communicate with node
A I have to send packets to node C. Node D does not need to know more than
that.

The first example was of course very simple. So what happens if the network
looks like this:


       *------- B --------- C ------*
       |                            |
   A --+-------------- D -----------+-- F
       |                            |
       *-------------- E -----------*

What does B.A.T.M.A.N do now?

Node A broadcasts an originator-message with sequence number 0. B, C, D and E
all forward this message.

Node F receives the originator-message sequence number 0 from node A
forwarded by node D first and memorizes that it has seen A over D. Node F
ignores the originator-message with sequence number 0 from A, that it
receives from node C because it receives the same message again. The message
forwarded by node E may get lost or come too late to be the first, too.

Using the best path between node A and F the packets travel more
reliable and/or quicker. B.A.T.M.A.N. nodes consider the best path to
a destination only as far as to the best next hop (or neighbor)
towards the destination. The best next hop is simply identified by
gathering statistics about how often and via which neighbor a certain
originator and sequence number has been received first.

For the above given scenario, all node F has to do is memorize where it
gets most originator messages from. Speed is decisive, because node F
is only memorizing who is forwarding the packet first. If node F wants
to communicate with node A it simply sends its packets to the node
with the best statistic.

If the statistic is equal amongst two or more neighbors the biggest
TTL is decisive. If also the TTL is equal the last received originator
packet is decisive.



TABLES MAINTAINED BY B.A.T.M.A.N.

1.) Table of symmetric single hop neighbors

Each node maintains a list of direct neighbors that contains all nodes that
it has a direct bidirectional (symmetric) communication link to.
Bidirectional links are detected when a originator receives its
self-initiated originator messages getting directly repeated by its
neighbors.

2.) Table of Originators and Ranking

This table contains all nodes that are detected by receiving their
originator messages and the number of originator-sequence-number
packets received first via the particular neighbor. The best neighbor
for each originator is added to the kernel routing table of the
underlying operating system as router to the originator.

Example: Ranking table in Node Q

List of		Originator packets received from
Originators	Neighbor A    Neighbor B   Neighbor C    Neighbor D

A 		    12		    9		 7		3

B		    3		    7		 17	  	4

C		    0		    3		 27		1

D		    0		    2	 	 17	        8

X		    3		    3	   	 9		4

Y	 	    9		    1		 12		2
			    	    

According to the ranking table Q would route payload traffic to:

A via A
B via C
C via C
D via C
X via C
Y via C


ORIGINATOR MESSAGE RANKING POLICY

If a originator message with a unknown sequence number is received first via
a bidirectional neighbor the packet count is increased for this neighbor.


ORIGINATOR MESSAGE FORWARDING POLICY

(Sorry if this sounds like program code :)

Only originator packets that are received via the best ranking
neighbor are rebroadcasted. This must also be
done if the originator-sequence-number tuple has already been seen via
another (non-best) neighbor as long as the TTL does not differ to the
last originator-sequence-number tuple that has been seen from the best
neighbor first.


BIDIRECTIONAL NEIGHBOR DETECTION AND UNIDIRECTIONAL FLAG

Originator messages initiated from single hop neighbors are always
re-broadcasted.  If we don't receive our own self-initiated originator
messages getting rebroadcasted by a neighbor we add a unidirectional
flag before rebroadcasting the originator message of this neighbor.

There is one exception where the unidirectional flag is used in
response to originator packets from bidirectional single-hop
neighbors:

If a bidirectional neighbor is not the best ranking neighbor to itself
(ah, you're getting confused now, eh?!) we rebroadcast the originator
packet containing the unidirectional flag.

Originator messages with unidirectional flag that were not initiated by us
are always ignored. If we see a neighbor directly repeat our self-initiated
originator messages there is obviously a bidirectional link between
us.

Happy testing!
