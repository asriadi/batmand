.SH NAME
batctl - B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced control and managing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B batctl
.RI \fImodule\fP\ [\fIoptions\fP]\ {\fIdestination\ or\ interface\fP}
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced operates on layer 2 and thus all hosts participating in the virtual switch are completely transparent for all protocols above layer 2. Therefore the common diagnosis tools do not work as expected. To overcome these problems \fBbatctl\fP was created. At the moment the batctl contains \fBping\fP, \fBtraceroute\fP, \fBtcpdump\fP interfaces to the kernel module settings.
.PP
batctl uses the /dev/batman-adv device provided by the B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced kernel module to inject custom icmp packets into the data flow. Thats why ping and traceroute work almost like their IP based counterparts. Tcpdump analyzes the traffic and packet types used B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RI \fBbatctl\ ping\fP\ [\fIoptions\fP]\ [\fImac\ address|host\ name\fP]
The following options are supported:
.RSs
.IPs "-c (count)"
stop after n pings (default is infinite)
.IPs "-i (interval)"
interval to wait between 2 pings (default is 1 second)
.IPs "-t (timeout interval)"
timeout interval in seconds (default is 1 second)
.RE


.TP
.RI \fBbatctl\ traceroute\fP\ [\fImac\ address|host name\fP]
Traceroute sends 3 packets to each hop, awaits the answers and prints out the response times.

.TP
.RI \fBbatctl\ tcpdump\fP\ [\fIoptions\fP]\ [\fIinterface\fP]
The following options are supported:
.RSs
.IPs "-a (all packets)"
switch tcpdump behaviour to work as the "normal" tcpdump and filter for non-batman advanced packets
.IPs "-d (dump packets)"
print packet data in hex
.IPs "-p (packet type)"
specify to filter for certain batman packets:

.RSss
.IPs "1"
batman packets - these transport the B.A.T.M.A.N. originator messages to build the mesh network
.IPs "2"
batman icmp packets - lightweight implementation of the ICMP protocol (needed for ping and traceroute)
.IPs "3"
batman unicast packets - unicast data is bound as payload in these packets
.IPs "4"
batman broadcast packets - broadcast data is bound as payload in these packets
.RE

.IPs "-v (verbose)"
prints more information about each packet
.RE
.br
.SH FILES
.IPs bat-hosts
This file is simliar to the /etc/hosts file. You can write one MAC address and one host name per line. The batctl will analyze the file to find the matching MAC address to your provided host name. Host names are much easier to remember than MAC addresses.  ;)
