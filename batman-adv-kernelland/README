batman-core
-----------
The kernel implementation of batman-advanced. It does not depend on any network
driver, and can be used on wifi as well as ethernet, vpn, etc ... (anything
with ethernet-style layer 2).
This is probably what you want if you want to try out the batman-advanced kernel
implementation. :)
Just "make" in the batman-core directory to link it against your target kernel,
and insmod the batman-adv-core.ko in your kernel. We tested it with 2.6.22 and 2.6.23.
It may also work with older versions but definitely not with 2.4. If you want to work
on the backport feel free to contact us.  :-)

802.11
------
There was an idea of integrating batman-advanced protocol information into
wifi managment frames. This is currently incomplete.
