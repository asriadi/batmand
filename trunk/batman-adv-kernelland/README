BATMAN-ADV
----------

The kernel implementation of batman-advanced. It does not depend on any network
driver, and can be used on wifi as well as ethernet, vpn, etc ... (anything
with ethernet-style layer 2).
It compiles against and should work with Linux 2.6.20 - 2.6.28. Supporting older
versions is not planned, but it's probably easy to backport it. If you work on a
backport, feel free to contact us.  :-)

COMPILE
-------
To compile against your currently installed kernel, just type:

# make

if you want to compile against some other kernel, use:

# make KERNELPATH=/path/to/kernel

USAGE
-----

insmod the batman-adv.ko in your kernel:

# insmod batman-adv.ko

the module is now waiting for activation. You must add some interfaces
on which batman can operate. Each interface must be added separately:

# echo wlan0 > /proc/net/batman-adv/interfaces

( # echo wlan1 > /proc/net/batman-adv/interfaces )
( # echo eth0 > /proc/net/batman-adv/interfaces )
( ... )

Now batman starts broadcasting on this interface.
You can now view the table of originators (mesh participants) with:

# cat /proc/net/batman-adv/originators

The module will create a new interface "bat0", which can be used as a
regular interface:

# ifconfig bat0 inet 192.168.0.1 up
# ping 192.168.0.2
...

If you want topology visualization, your meshnode must be configured
as VIS-server:

# echo "server" > /proc/net/batman-adv/vis

When configured as server, you can get a topology snapshot of your mesh:

# cat /proc/net/batman-adv/vis

This output can be processeed with graphviz-tools like dot.
The labels are similar/compatible to the ETX metric, 1.0 means perfect
connection (100%), 2.0 means 50%, 3.0 means 33% and so on.

To deactivate batman, do:

# echo "" > /proc/net/batman-adv/interfaces
